In order to run the code, you will need to install dependencies. It is best to make a virtual environment. You can do this with:

```
python3 -m venv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
```

Then install dependencies with 

```
pip install torch
pip install numpy
```

After installing dependencies, run the code with

```
python3 main.py
```
